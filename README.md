## What is Frontend Mentor?

Frontend Mentor is a platform designed to help aspiring front-end developers improve their skills by providing them with real-world coding challenges and projects. It offers a variety of projects of increasing difficulty levels, ranging from simple landing pages to more complex web applications.

The platform provides detailed design mockups along with project requirements and specifications. Users are tasked with coding the front-end of these projects using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Once completed, users can submit their solutions for review and feedback from the community or mentors.

Frontend Mentor aims to simulate the experience of working as a front-end developer by providing projects that mimic real-world scenarios. This allows users to practice their coding skills, learn new techniques, and build their portfolio in a supportive environment. Additionally, Frontend Mentor offers a Pro subscription that provides access to premium challenges and additional features to further enhance the learning experience.
